# Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers

Welcome to the official GitHub repository complementing the book **"Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Mechanical Engineers"** â€” a hands-on guide designed to bridge the gap between core mechanical engineering concepts and modern machine learning techniques.

ðŸš§ **Repository Under Construction** ðŸš§  
This repository is currently being set up. Bookmark this page and stay tuned!

## ðŸ“˜ About the Book
The book provides an accessible yet thorough introduction to machine learning, tailored specifically for mechanical engineers. It covers:
- Fundamental ML concepts and algorithms
- Practical applications in thermodynamics, structural analysis, fluid dynamics, and materials science
- Real-world case studies and datasets
- Python-based examples using libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Pandas

## ðŸ§  What This Repository Will Include
Once complete, this repository will serve as an open-source resource featuring:
- Jupyter notebooks for every chapter
- Sample datasets and preprocessing scripts
- Additional exercises and solutions
- Project templates and guided mini-projects
- Visualizations and model performance analysis

## ðŸ“… Coming Soon
- [ ] Chapter-by-chapter notebooks  
- [ ] Dataset descriptions and sourcing  
- [ ] Code for all hands-on examples  
- [ ] Bonus materials and updates
